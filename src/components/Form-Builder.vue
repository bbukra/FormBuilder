  When you have a great story Form-Builder how your product or service was built to change lives, share it. The "Form-Builder Us" page is a great place for it to live, too. Good stories humanize your brand, providing context and meaning for your product. Whatâ€™s more, good stories are sticky -- which means people are more likely to connect with them and pass them on.
